#### Part A. Actuating DC motors

#### Part B. Actuating Servo motors

##### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

##### a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?

power - red

orange - pin 9

brown - ground

##### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

##### a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?

Pin 9

##### b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?

Angle -> myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
Speed -> delay(15);  

#### Part C. Integrating input and output

##### Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.

Here, I was ensuring that my servo could work with the potentiometer.
